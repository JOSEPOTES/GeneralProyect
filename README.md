#About this repo:
it's a basic repo where I show my basic learning in python, currently I am running into proyects from zero to hero.
I am open to suggestions and better practices for python, feel free to take this repo and make it better, it has some bad practices, redudant code and unnecesary loops.
so, I will retake it later and make it better but, I will continue practicing and learning more before touch it.
